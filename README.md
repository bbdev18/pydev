# Introduction

This repository documents all the useful python code, tips, and tricks I have learnt over the years. It is also a place to store certain things I learnt that I don't want to forget. I hope this may be useful to you as well!

Let's begin!

# Where to start

The main resource of the repository is the wiki, so go ahead to that now if you want to get started: https://github.com/bbdev18/pydev/wiki

There is also the code repository that stores all the source code that I have created, which can be found here: https://github.com/bbdev18/pydev

Hope you find something useful!
